The grep family consists of the commands grep, egrep and fgrep. The grep command globally
 searches for regular expressions in files and prints all lines that contain the expression.
The egrep and fgrep commands are simply a variant of grep. The egrep command is 
an extended grep, supporting more regular expression metacharacters. 
The fgrep command, called fixed grep, and sometimes called fast grep, 
treats all characters as literals; 
that is regular expression characters aren't special, they match themselves.

A metacharacter is a character that represents something other than itself. 
^ and  $ are examples of metacharacters.
